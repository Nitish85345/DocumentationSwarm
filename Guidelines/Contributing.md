# Guidelines fo making contribution
* Most members won't have maintainers' right. Hence, you will not be able to
push codes directly to the repository. Instead, you need to fork this repository
(and star it)
* Make it a practice to keep your local repository updated with the source repository.
Ideally you should `git pull` or `git fetch` everytime you start working on any of the folders
* Check if there is any assigned issues against your name.
* Make a separate `branch` for each of your contribution. Use `git checkout` to move to your experimental branch
* Then make changes to any of your code/files/folders and make logical commits (multiple commits if the task is long)
* Donot forget to sign the commit message (use `--signoff` with `git commit`)
* Read [this](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53#file-commit-message-guidelines-md) for guidelines about how to write commit messages
* Make a successful build before submitting (We will add continous integration (CI) later)
* Submit a Pull Request (PR) against the issue
* Be active till the PR is either merged
* Check mails regularly
